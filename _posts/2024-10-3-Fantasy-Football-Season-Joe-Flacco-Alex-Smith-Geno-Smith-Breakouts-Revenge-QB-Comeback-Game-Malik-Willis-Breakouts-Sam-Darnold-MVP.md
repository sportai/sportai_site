<span style=”font-size:2em;”>J</span>ust a quarter into the NFL season, many former quarterback “busts” have made spectacular comeback performances, surprising the world. Therefore, the rise of these QBs has officially made the 2020s the decade of the comeback QB.

#### Revenge for Undefeated Vikings QB 

For example, Sam Darnold is the star QB of the undefeated Minnesota Vikings, a stark contrast from his days in New York and Carolina. Darnold is an early contender for NFL MVP since he leads the league in touchdowns, passer rating, and yards gained per attempt.

Darnold has faced many struggles since the New York Jets drafted him third overall in 2018. Under the severe pressure of being chosen as the top pick to save the franchise, Darnold underperformed and was traded to Carolina in 2021 for draft picks. 

Unlike his time with the Jets and Carolina, Darnold has the explosive weapons and an offensive-minded coaching staff in Minnesota needed for QBs to succeed in the NFL. Specifically, superstars WR Justin Jefferson and RB Aaron Jones have made it significantly easier for Darnold to drive downfield and execute on scoring opportunities. 

Vikings Head Coach Kevin O’Connell also proved his ability to maximize veteran quarterback play after helping Kirk Cousins become a top QB in the NFL under O’Connell’s scheme. Similarly, Darnold’s **familiarity** with quarterback coach Josh McCown has connected the dots for the experienced QB as he looks to continue his MVP-caliber play. 

In week five, Darnold faces his old team, the New York Jets, in London, which will be a difficult test against the top-tier defense. However, the **revenge game** will determine for many people if Sam Darnold is the **real deal**.

#### Short But Fantastic Stunt from Highly-Rated 2022 QB Draft Prospect

Before the 2024 season, many disregarded the Packers’s trade for QB Malik Willis, sending a seventh-round pick to the Tennessee Titans in return for the underwhelming QB. However, the trade immediately paid off, with Willis capitalizing on starter QB Jordan Love’s ankle injury, causing him to miss two games. 

In those two games, Willis proved he was the dual-threat quarterback people hyped him up to be. He threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another in his two-game stint while averaging 9.5 yards per attempt, ending up with a passer rating of 122.7.

Ironically, Willis defeated his former team, the Tennesee Titans, 30-14 in a breakout revenge game for the young QB. With the help of star RB Josh Jacobs and playmakers Jayden Reed and Romeo Doubs, Willis has proven that he is no longer the “bust” that the Titans made him play like. 

The Packers’ coaching staff and playcalling also contributed to Willis’s success, reinforcing the brilliance of Matt LaFleur, who helped transform Jordan Love into a superstar QB. Willis possesses the tools to succeed in the NFL, and it will be only a matter of time before the Packers trade him to a QB-needy team like the Raiders or Dolphins.

#### Former Browns QB and His New 100 Million-Dollar Contract  

After the 2020 season, Baker Mayfield was the future for the Cleveland Browns at the quarterback position. He had helped break a 26-year-old playoff victory curse, which plagued the Browns organization. 

He also looked like the first Browns quarterback in a while who could propel the team into becoming Super Bowl contenders. However, after a disappointing 2021 season where the Browns missed the playoffs with an 8-9 record, and playing through a partially torn labrum that greatly limited his play, Mayfield was traded to the Carolina Panthers. 

In Carolina, Mayfield had an underwhelming tenure with the organization during the 2022 season, losing five of the six games he started. As a result, it seemed that Mayfield, who was selected with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, would end his career as a mediocre player who made a questionable decision to play through injury. 

Luckily, Mayfield got his final chance with the Los Angeles Rams after QB Matthew Stafford got injured. Two days after being claimed off waivers, Mayfield was thrust into the starting quarterback role in a game against the Las Vegas Raiders. 
Down 13 in the fourth quarter, Mayfield piloted two scoring drives, including a 98-yard game-winning touchdown sequence with under two minutes left. Consequently, Mayfield’s stock rose heavily, earning him more starts for the Rams in the 2022-2023 season.

Due to his electric stint for the Rams, Mayfield earned a one-year prove-it deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after he reached out for an opportunity. Throughout the 2023-2024 season, Mayfield bolstered the case for his revival as a top-tier QB, leading the Buccaneers to a playoff appearance and win against the Eagles. 

Ultimately, his stellar performance landed him a multi-year 100 million dollar contract extension in the offseason, cementing his place as a top quarterback in the NFL. Likewise, Mayfield has led the Buccaneers to a 3-1 start to the 2024 NFL season, strengthening his comeback.

#### Former Second-Round Pick Turned Franchise QB and Two-Time Pro Bowler

After waiting a decade, Geno Smith finally got his chance to shine under excellent coaching while surrounded by top-tier offensive teammates, similar to former Jets QB Sam Darnold. 
Smith’s career resurgence occurred shortly after longtime franchise QB Russell Wilson was traded to the Denver Broncos. 

The departure left a void at the quarterback position filled by Smith. After being Wilson’s backup for three years, Smith broke out in 2022, earning a Pro Bowl nod while leading the team to the playoffs. 

Smith’s spectacular season earned him the 2022 AP Comeback Player of the Year award, reiterating his career revival. He also outplayed Russell Wilson, who finished fourth in the AFC West with the Broncos and missed the playoffs. 

After signing a three-year 75 million dollar contract in the 2022 offseason, Smith continued his Pro Bowl-caliber play, receiving his second appearance. Intriguingly, Smith led the league in game-winning drives and fourth-quarter comebacks in 2023, highlighting Smith’s resilience and grit throughout matches. 

Overall, Smith encompasses the comeback QB era of the 2020s because he overcame a decade of adversity to shine. His fall and rise illustrate the difficulties of being an NFL quarterback, revealing why many QBs become busts.

#### Honorable Mentions and Comeback QB Summary

Since many QBs were not featured in individual sections, here are some honorable mentions. These QBs include Joe Flacco, Alex Smith, and Justin Fields. 

First, Joe Flacco returned in 2024 after overcoming all odds, defeating the undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers in week four. Previously, 39-year-old Flacco led the Browns to a playoff appearance during the 2023 season after Deshaun Watson had a season-ending injury. 

Next, Alex Smith was a former first-overall pick who almost lost his leg due to a severe injury during the 2018 season. However, Smith fought his way back through challenging rehabilitation, playing in the 2020 season for the Washington Football Team, completing his near-impossible comeback. As a result, he would win the AP Comeback Player of the Year in 2021. 

Finally, Justin Fields has won the starting role in Pittsburgh after leading the team to a 3-0 start in the 2024 season before losing to Flacco and the Colts in week four. Still, he has proven himself to be a stable dual-threat option at quarterback, defying the odds after the Bears traded him. 

Similarly, Sam Darnold, Malik Willis, Baker Mayfield, and Geno Smith have made similar revenge stories, proving that the right system or coaching staff can change a player’s career. Therefore, the 2020s are the era of the comeback quarterback because of the many successful career resurgences for quarterbacks.
