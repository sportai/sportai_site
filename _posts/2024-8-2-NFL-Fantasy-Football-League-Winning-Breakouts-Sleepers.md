<span style="font-size:2em;">L</span>ate-round league winners can determine a fantasy football season. These players are the difference between becoming the champion versus not even making the playoffs. For example, Puka Nacua in 2023 was drafted as a late-round sleeper but turned out to be a top-five wide receiver. Therefore, there are a lot of **low-risk** picks that can return *serious value* for a team.

#### Top QB Sleeper 

Coming off a solid rookie season, Will Levis **exceeded expectations** in 2023 after starting eight games for the Tennesse Titans, who originally named him the third-string quarterback. 

In those eight starts from week 8 to 15, he ranked **15th among QBs in fantasy**. Surprisingly, he performed well in a run-heavy environment, and with subpar pass-receiving options. 

The Titans have also hired former Bengals offensive coordinator **Brian Callahan** as their head coach. He is known as a pass-preference play caller, with his Cincinnati offenses ranking top-6 in pass rate three times. 

The Titans have also signed **RB Tony Pollard** and **WR Calvin Ridley** in free agency, both top players in their positions, giving Levis more weapons. The Titans still have **DeAndre Hopkins** and young WR Treylon Burks to help Levis. 
 
Overall, Callahan’s arrival will help Levis develop into a **pass-first quarterback**, and the Titan’s new additions in free agency give Levis many options to **perform well** in fantasy this year. His ranking as a QB27 labels Levis as a *late-round steal* for teams who can get him.

#### Top RB Sleeper 


Coming off a career-best season, **Zack Moss** was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals to be their *lead running back* after **Joe Mixon**, their long-time starter, *was traded* to the Houston Texans. 

Zach Moss performed well last year as a starting back in some games for the Indianapolis Colts. Specifically, he was superb in **advanced metrics, ranking fifth** among 51 RBs in **rushing yards over expected** per attempt. 

In the six outings when he had a snap rate above 50%, he averaged 20.2 carries, 87 rushing yards, and 0.5 TDs. As a result, his **16.4 PPR** *(Point Per Reception)* **points** per game would have ranked him seventh among RBs. 

Still, he may not get as much volume as Joe Mixon because promising second-year RB Chase Brown displayed his big-play ability in a few games. 

Ultimately, Zack Moss has an **ADP around 84**, making him an 8th or 9th-round pick, suggesting players can draft him cheaply as an RB2 or RB3 *steal*. If he performs well and keeps the RB1 spot, Zack Moss can become a top-5 RB in fantasy, similar to past Joe Mixon.

#### Top WR Sleeper 


In 2020, Curtis Samuel had his **best fantasy season** as a Carolina Panther under offensive coordinator **Joe Brady**. Since then, he has had a *disappointing three-year tenure* as a Washington Commander. 

However, Samuel is now a Buffalo Bill. The **Bills have Joe Brady** as their offensive coordinator, reuniting the duo. The **Bills GM Brandon Beane** also stated that they see Samuel as a versatile player who is not a traditional wide receiver. 

Likewise, Samuel has a **top-tier rushing ability**, which makes him a valuable asset to the Bills offense. The Bills also have a dominant quarterback Josh Allen, who will help Samuel achieve his potential as a *top-20 fantasy wide receiver*. 

The Bills also lost **WR1 Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis**, which opens the door for Samuel to get a significant amount of targets. He also comes off of back-to-back seasons with 60+ catches in Washington, showcasing his consistency. 

Overall, Samuel’s *ADP is 111.71*, indicating that he is drafted in the 11th round, making him a spectacular steal for teams prioritizing other positions and wanting to invest in a low-risk high-reward player. 

With Joe Brady as his OC and Josh Allen as his quarterback, Curtis Samuel is **primed** for a huge season as a **primary playmaker** for the Bills.

#### Late-round League-winner player summary

The 2024 NFL season will undoubtedly have undervalued players who provide amazing value for their teams. These rare players can help fantasy team owners win their leagues in dominating fashion. 

Overall, Will Levis is the **sleeper QB** for fantasy players to look out for because of Titan’s pass-first offensive coordinator and new offensive weapons that can help Levis out. 

Second, Zack Moss is the *sleeper RB* for fantasy teams interested in late-round production that can blossom into a top-five running back. Moss has the RB1 spot for the Bengals and should perform well if he keeps that spot during the 2024 season. 

Finally, Curtis Samuel reunites with his favorite OC Joe Brady on the Buffalo Bills, who lost two crucial weapons to their offense. Samuel will fill that void, offering an elite rushing ability that makes him a **top playmaker** for Josh Allen. 

Ultimately, **aspiring** Fantasy Football **League winners** should consider these late-round undervalued stars since they can provide serious value while being low-risk if they do not pan out.
