<span style="font-size:2em;">H</span>eading into the NBA season, many fantasy basketball managers are excited to outscore their league-mates through savvy draft selections and trades. Therefore, here are three players to look out for in your drafts.

First, **rookie** Zach Edey is an intriguing player who should have a significant role for the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies drafted Edey **9th overall** in the 2024 NBA draft, hoping his potentially **high-level production** will **calm doubts about** his athleticism. 

Edey is a proven player who led the Purdue Boilermakers to a NCAA March Madness national championship appearance. In his final season with the Boilermakers, he averaged **25.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 2.3 blocks, and 2.0 assists**. 

Edey’s **massive frame** at seven-foot-four-inches and 285 pounds allow him to **dominate the paint**, get rebounds, and protect the hoop. Edey will also receive help from *top-tier point guard* and teammate Ja Morant, who will help Edey bloom into a **breakout superstar** in his rookie season. 

Edey offers tremendous value since he is the 36th player taken off the board at his position. However, Edey is top-15 if he performs well in his rookie season.

LaMelo Ball’s current **ADP of 24.2** is too low for his top-tier talent. Still, his drop in value is due to his last two *consecutive injury-ridden seasons* in which he played only 58 games total. 

Since he was a unanimous first-round pick in these two seasons, his injuries frustrated many managers. However, Ball has a first-round return since he has **career averages** of 20 PPG, 7.4 APG, and 6.2 RPG with 1.6 SPG. 

Also, the Charlotte Hornets play at a quick pace, leaving Ball many opportunities to succeed in impressing fantasy owners. Overall, the 23-year-old all-star is someone **likely to outperform his ADP** with an injury-free season.

After being traded by the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2023 due to decreasing performance and role on the team, Chicago should offer a **nice change of scenery** for Josh Giddey. Giddey will have chances to succeed in Chicago and should play plenty of minutes. 

However, Giddey is a flawed off-ball player who needs the ball to be effective. He struggles beyond the arc and cannot play lockdown defense. 

Still, Giddey’s current ADP of 68.6 is too low for a **talented young player** primed to break out on a new team. Giddey has teammates Coby White and Zach Lavine, who can **receive his assists** since they are both lethal sharpshooters. 

Overall, Giddey is a solid sleeper mid-round pick who can **significantly outplay** his current ADP and surprise fantasy managers. He should be a top target for owners focused on maximizing value from the draft. 

#### Top 2024 Fantasy Basketball Sleepers Summary

In conclusion, Zach Edey, LaMelo Ball, and Josh Giddey are all the top sleepers for the 2024 fantasy basketball season. 

Edey possesses an **excellent college track record and tremendous size** to succeed at the center position and accumulate many rebounds and blocks. 

Ball’s ADP is significantly lower than his potential performance due to injuries. However, Ball is too talented to be drafted in the second round and has a **massive possible return** for people who draft him. 

Giddey’s move to Chicago should help him be a primary playmaker on a new team with great sharpshooters. Giddey’s current ADP can be **easily outmatched** by his play and he is an amazing mid-round value pick for managers. 

Ultimately, these sleepers can help your team **dominate your league** and come out on top.
