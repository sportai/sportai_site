During the fantasy football season, **sleepers and steals** can propel a team to victory. 

Intriguingly, many rookies can make a valuable impact on their team while having a low ADP compared to seasoned veterans. For example, Puka Nacua and Sam LaPorta dominated fantasy leagues in 2023 with historic seasons. 

Therefore, since these rookies are not highly drafted in many leagues, the 2024-2025 fantasy football season is another opportunity for fantasy managers to sweep the competition with fabulous picks. 


#### Top Rookie QB Steals

For QBs, **six** were drafted in the first round, tying the 1983 draft record. Still, the two top picks are the most intriguing: **Bears’ Caleb Williams** and the **Commanders’ Jayden Daniels**. 

Williams joins an explosive Bears squad that includes **top wide receiver** DJ Moore, Keenan Allen, and rookie Rome Odunze, the WR3 behind Harrison Jr. and Nabers. 

He is primed to succeed in Chicago and will look to start his career strong. His projected QB ranking at #16 may regard him as a **steal** in the draft.

On the other hand, Jayden Daniels solves the desperate QB situation in Washington, which last had a stable option during 2018 with Kirk Cousins. 

Unfortunately, Daniels steps in a less talented group of teammates, given only Terry Mclaurin as a notable star. The offensive line also looks rough, a persistent issue for the Commanders who could not grab top talent in the draft. 

However, Daniels does have the **highest potential to be a scrambler**, similar to Lamar Jackson, which could increase his value. Daniels’ ADP at 116 could also make him a **steal** for players looking to **boost other positions** in the earlier rounds. 

#### Rookie Wide Reciever Steals and Sleepers

For Wide Receivers, the top talent of Harrison Jr., Nabers, and Odunze make them attractive targets in the draft. However, the **Chargers’ Ladd McConkey** and **Bills’ Keon Coleman** competing for the **WR1** spot on their respective teams make them appealing options. 

McConkey could become the **top target** for Justin Herbert since Joshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston have had disappointing starts to their careers. 

Similarly, the **departure** of Stephon Diggs via trade opens up the depth chart for Coleman, who is 6-foot-3, to become the **top touchdown target for Josh Allen**. 

Finally, Xavier Worthy may become the **next Tyreek Hill** for Patrick Mahomes after breaking the NFL Combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash. 

Therefore, McConkey’s ranking as the number 43 WR, Coleman's listed as the number 53 WR, and Worthy’s projected ADP at #104 make them **all sleepers** who could **significantly contribute** to fantasy teams if they succeed.

#### Top Rookie Steals and Sleepers Summary

While top rookies such as Marvin Harrison Jr. and Malik Nabers can be fruitful picks, there are better sleepers and draft steals. 

For example, Ladd McConkey, Keon Coleman, and Xaiver Worthy are savvy picks battling for their team’s WR1 spot. 

Similarly, Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels are quality options for players prioritizing other positions. 

Ultimately, **hopeful Fantasy Football League winners** should **draft these promising 2024 NFL rookies** for their team since they can **provide enormous value at a discounted price**.
