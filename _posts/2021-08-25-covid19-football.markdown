NFL Pre-Season is coming to an end. Rosters are being finalized. Fantasy Drafts are starting. But one concern amongst fans and players remains...

How will COVID-19 affect the NFL Season?

### The Numbers

According the most recent [official report](https://apnews.com/article/sports-nfl-health-coronavirus-pandemic-indianapolis-colts-bad1d99912dd5cfd78539bb755be122f):
- 88.5% of players have had at least one shot of the vaccine
- 20 of the 32 teams are at least 90% vaccinated

Based on these findings, perhaps the concern surrounding non-vaccinated players isn't as great as it seems. For comparison, 47.1% of the United States is [unvaccinated](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker). The NFL's population is 10% unvaccinated and continuing to drop.

However, there are still important rules the NFL has established regarding COVID-19.

### League Rules:
1. Vaccines are not required
2. Non-vaccinated players must get daily COVID tests
3. Discrepancies or negative tests immediately result in 5-day quarantine from the facility
4. Non-vaccinated players are required to always wear masks in facilities

Most importantly, if a team has a COVID outbreak among its unvaccinated players and the game cannot be re-scheduled during the 18-week season, they will have to forfeit the cancelled game and have it count as a loss on their season record. Teams also have the freedom to enforce individual rules. As a result, some teams have a [fully vaccinated roster](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/atlanta-falcons-covid-vaccine-100-percent-nfl/).

### Implications for the Fantasy Football Season:

The risk of COVID-19 issues affecting your fantasy roster, while not technically high, is something to consider.
Examples like the [Cam Newton situation](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/sports/nfl/patriots/2021/08/23/cam-newton-out-due-nfl-covid-19-rules-will-it-cost-him-new-england-patriots-starting-quarterback/8245980002/) could lead Mac Jones to starter are why you need to be careful while drafting. 
Other players like DeAndre Hopkins, Cole Beasley, and Kirk Cousins have said they refuse to get the vaccine. While players like Ryan Tannehill received it [just to avoid the strict NFL protocols](https://theathletic.com/news/titans-ryan-tannehill-only-got-covid-19-vaccine-because-of-nfl-protocols/uGGzIOw0yrZu). 

This requires a constantly observant fantasy player to:
- Possibly prioritize players on teams with higher vaccination rates
- Constantly track the COVID status of players
