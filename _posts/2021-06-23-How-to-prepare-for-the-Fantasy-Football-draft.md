With Fantasy Football season right around the corner, there’s a lot you can do to prepare for a killer draft. The team at SportAI has compiled a list of things you should keep an eye out for going into the draft.

###Do your own research

We already know how many fantasy “gurus” sell their snake oil advice. That’s why we urge you to do your own research! It doesn’t have to be extensive and time consuming. Already have your eye on a few players? Take a quick look at:
-	How have they performed in the past against the teams in their upcoming schedule? You might be able to draft them expecting strong performances early in the season before trading them for some late bloomers.
-	Has their supporting cast changed? Take a look at the key pieces that they rely on. If your QB lost his line or top receivers, you might want to look elsewhere.
-	Keep an eye on coaching changes across the board. With new coaches or coordinators come new systems, which benefit some and hurt others.
-	Injury history should not be underestimated. Spending a high pick on an injury prone player is very risky. The marginal differences between a top 3 positional performer compared to a top 10 positional performer aren’t worth it if the top 3 player is out for half the year.
