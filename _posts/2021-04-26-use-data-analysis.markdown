### What is SportAI?

SportAI is changing how people play fantasy sports by putting the power of AI in your pocket. The SportAI team members are data scientists by day and sports fanatics by night whose passion is to find the intersection between these two worlds. We love playing fantasy, running leagues, and crunching numbers.

Anyone can do the first two, but sports data analysis can be confusing and difficult to access. Whether it’s football or basketball, that’s where SportAI comes in. Test your lineup’s Score+, adjust, and win. Trust the machine. It’s that simple.
